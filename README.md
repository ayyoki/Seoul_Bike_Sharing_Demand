## Project Overview
The core objective of this project is to forecast the number of bicycles rented in Seoul using supervised machine learning techniques. By employing a regression algorithm, the project aims to predict bicycle rental counts based on a range of factors including temporal elements and environmental conditions.


## Model programming environment
The project used Google Colab as an environment for developing and training the model, providing access to free computing resources.

## Libraries Utilized
In this project, the following libraries are integral to our analysis and model development:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `missingno`: For visualizing missing data.
- `xgboost`: For optimized gradient boosting machine learning algorithms.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning tools.
- `joblib`: For saving and loading models.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project can be accessed on Kaggle: [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-sharing-demand-prediction/data).

### Model Selection
Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using `GridsearchCV` to identify the optimal model for regression.

### Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- r2_score
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MSE (Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

## Model Deployment
The model was deployed using the `Flask` web framework, facilitating interaction with the predictive model via a web interface.

The model itself is in '.pkl' format and is located at the following path:
